# Brief history and background of the city

Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, boasts a rich and diverse history that spans over a thousand years. Its origins can be traced back to the early medieval period when it was established as a royal burgh by King David I in the 12th century. Over the centuries, Edinburgh evolved into a significant political, cultural, and economic hub, playing a pivotal role in the nation's history. The city's strategic location on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth contributed to its growth, as it became a vital center for trade and commerce.

One of the defining moments in Edinburgh's history occurred in the 15th century when King James II constructed the imposing Edinburgh Castle on Castle Rock. This iconic fortress has stood witness to countless historical events, including battles, royal ceremonies, and political intrigue. The city's medieval layout, characterized by narrow closes and wynds, is still evident in the Old Town, providing visitors with a tangible connection to its past. In 1707, the Act of Union merged the parliaments of England and Scotland, leading to the establishment of the United Kingdom. Edinburgh continued to thrive as the capital of Scotland, contributing significantly to the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century, a period marked by intellectual and scientific advancements.

In the 19th century, Edinburgh experienced further expansion and modernization, with the construction of the New Town showcasing neoclassical architecture and urban planning.
